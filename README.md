## Introduction
Project Zero -- Space Game: The Insanity Descent is a time based browser experience where an astronaut seeking interplanetary travel has found complications after having crashed on an unknown planet, in an unrecognizable planetary system. The Astronaut will have to eat, sleep and find productivity amongst this newly discovered environment, or risk dying a lonesome death.

## Main Narrative

1. His spaceship has no fuel, he had a hard landing and suffered a blunt trauma to the head. Canâ€™t remember how he got there or what his mission is, but he just needs to survive.
