## Introduction
Project Zero -- Space Game: The Insanity Descent is a time based browser experience where an astronaut seeking interplanetary travel has found complications after having crashed on an unknown planet, in an unrecognizable planetary system. Accompanied by a mischievous and questionable AI, HAL42, the Astronaut will have to eat, sleep and find productivity on this newly discovered environment, or risk dying a lonesome death.

## Main Narrative

1. The astronaut's spaceship broke through a Planet's exosphere without controlled deceleration. The Astronaut wakes up with no memory of events. The spaceship has no fuel and all that's left to do is survive. Eat periodically as well as sleep and staying productive in order for the Astronaut to survive. The AI HAL42 helps the Astronaut throughout his survival adventure.

## Wire Frames / User Story

1. Step One: Introduction of the Game Interface: 
User arrives at blank browser page with dark background color. After 1second, blank page is filled with animated text in "computer typing" style that presents User with Main Narrative Introduction (The basic backstory and explanation of what is to unfold. Who is the character, what has to happen and what will happen).
User has a choice: Click Play, or Click Do Not Play. If User Clicked Play, the following Step(2) happens.

2. Step Two: Present the User with the Game Interface:
User is presented with main image of character (astronaut) and a User Interface containing Hunger Level, Sleepiness and Boredom level. The browser page will show a set of explanative instructions regarding these levels. Hunger decreases over a set amount of time (x), Sleepiness increases over time, Boredom as well. 
User will read the instructions and get acquainted with interface. User will have the option to name their Astronaut when the Text Box located on the Left, prompts the User to do so.

3. Step Three: User acknowledges Instructions: Sleepiness can be Decreased by Sleeping, Boredom can be decreased by analyzing the environment, or dancing, or exercising. Hunger can be decreased by Eating Food Rations stored inside the Astronaut's spaceship. Each choice will show a windowed log within the Dialogue Box.
The user will watch the Astronaut grow older by the minute, and see the Astronaut's hunger, boredom and sleep levels change. The user will be prompted by the Dialogue Box when to feed the Astronaut, make him sleep or make him lose his boredom. 
If the user does not interact enough with the Astronaut, and either of the three levels increase over the set limit. The Astronaut will die and the user will be presented with a new "Character Dead" screen. 
4. The Final End Game Possibilities:
If during Step One, the user chose NOT to play the game, Step 2 & 3 are skipped and the user immediately sees End Game Option B (below). 
If the User Plays the Game but does not help the astronaut in time and lets limits of hunger,sleep,boredom accumulate. End Game Option A will fill screen.
